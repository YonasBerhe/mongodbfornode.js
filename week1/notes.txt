Mongo db is not a relational data base.


What does json stand for?
JSON
++

JSON is schemaless

++ Bson
   Binary json

++ Mongo db is schemaless
++ Mongo db is also schemaless

+- mongo db does not support joins
+- mongo does not support sql

+ Mongo db is scalable
   +- MongoDB does not support joins
   +
   + And Transactions


+ Depth of functionality

+++Mongo db shell
    +"show dbs" will allow us to see what dbs are available to us.

    + "use dbs" allows us to access a certain db. And it will create one if the db does not exsist.

    + db.x.find(), x is eqaul to the collection within the database.

    + directly query for a json document by copying

    +  loops in shell are a green light

    + Json document vs a key

    + Mongo script.js while mongo server is up to test your code on your mongo shell.

+++ Example query
   db.x.insert({a: 'the',b: 'foobar',c: 'foo', })

   valid json example

     "name" : hello {
       "foo" : {
          "c": 1,
          "b" : 1,
          "a" : 1,

       }
     }

+++ mongodb node.js

  + db.close should happen each time you return something from the database.



+++ AsycIO vs SyncIO

   \Look into both concepts

// IDEA: tellall emergency

+++expresss and templeting
   consolidate allows us to use other templeting engies in our express app.

// attention: app now allows us to integrate a templeting engine into our application.
   var cons = require('consolidate');

//using a templting engine
app.engine(html, cons.swig);
app.set('veiw engine', 'html');
app.set('views', __dirname + dir to  html)

passing in doc in a call back function will allow you to get, minipulate data about the mongo collections data.

+++ Express Url and Get request
app.use(app.router);?

++  handling post requests
  ++  res.render will allow us to render anything to the dom from our javascript.

  Json can be indexed fairly easy to manupulate on the fly
   ++ One you can assign queries to varibles.
   ++ var j = db
   ++ db.users.save(j)

   JSON ()
  arrays
   dictionaries is an accioate maps
   key word and values

   Example of valid JSON
   {
   //key
    "fruit": [
//values
        "apple",
        "pear",
        "peach"
    ]
}

Modeling our blog in mongo

Identify a document with in a collection with its id, or with a unique key value pair.

++Schema design

++ mongorestore take ish from dump file meaning databases an collections and add it to our serve (local server)
